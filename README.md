BAMED - Boundary Layer Pressurized Balloons trajectory simulation

BAMED is a Fortran based numeric tool that allows to simulate Boundary Layer Pressurized Balloons (BLPB) trajectories based on the given meteorological conditions. The model allows simulating balloon path from a given launch site (geographical coordinates) on the given date and time of the launch.

## Requirements
The BAMED tool is containrized into a Singularity container so one must have Singularity installed on the host system intended for simulations.

## Installation
1. git clone
